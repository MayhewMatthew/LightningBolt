# LightningBolt
Mayhew Lightning Bolt is the second software I develop using React Native. Its idea is actually pretty simple: when you shake your phone, its flashlight 
will turn on. It uses the Torch and Shake React Native libraries.

Lightning Bolt has a extremely simplified user interface, basically with Mayhew's logo on its short version (just a "M"). Lightning Bolt is, for me, the 
beggining of something bigger!
